# my_cloud_integrations
This is my data engineer side ! 🖥️
In this repository you can see what integrations I've done with different platforms API such as VTEX, GA4, SQL. 
For the moment, all my integrations are in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and they use Cloud Functions because this tool is really cheap and effcient !

List of Integrations: 

✔️ VTEX Master Data API v2 - Get documents (Customer information from CL data entity) 
✔️ GA4 API - Get main KPIs for e-Marketing reports (Sessions, Revenue, Orders, adImpressions, adClicks, adCost, CR, CTR, CPS, CPA, ROAS)

🏁 Microsoft SQL Server Integration - Get any database that is in a server. Still learning how to do this !
